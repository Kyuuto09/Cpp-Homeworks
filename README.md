📚 C++ Homeworks

This repo contains my C++ homework projects from ITStep Academy.  
Each homework is stored in a separate folder:

    cpp-hw1
    cpp-hw2
    cpp-hw3
    … up to the latest one

🖥️ Every folder has a project with source code and additional files if needed.

⚡ Why I made this repo:

    To keep all my work in one place
    To see my progress in C++ step by step
    To avoid having 20+ separate repos cluttering my profile

✨ Topics I covered so far:

    Basics of C++ syntax
    Variables, conditions and loops
    Functions and arrays
    Pointers and memory
    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
    Templates
    STL (Standard Template Library)
    File operations
    More advanced algorithms and data structures

👉 How to check a homework:

    Open the folder you want (for example cpp-hw5).
    Download the files or clone the repo.
    Compile and run with your C++ compiler (for example Visual Studio or g++).
    
📌 Note: These projects are made as assignments from ITStep Academy.  
They start from basics and go step by step into harder topics.  
They're not perfect (i'm javascript enjoyer 😅).
